	<h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        Labs originated in the island of Newfoundland in Canada. The first breed of these great animals was known as the St. John's water dog. 
		The first began working in the freezing North Atlantic Ocean helping fishermen haul nets and retrieving fish. 
		The breed was then brought to England and received the name Labrador Retriever for their immense ability to retrieve anything from within the water. 
		From here the friendly, playful breed took off and they are now present around the whole world. 
		Labradors are now the most popular breed of dog in America and their fun-loving spirit never disappoints. 
		One way to maintain labs happiness is to make sure they are well exercised because they enjoy having purpose and tasks. 
		It brings them back to their roots of being a dog for fishermen. 
        </p>
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>
        There are three different types of Labrador Retrievers, and each type is dependent on the color of their fur. 
		The three colors of fur are black, brown, and yellow. Males dogs weigh between 65 and 80 pounds, while females weigh between 55 and 70 pounds. 
		There are are two subtle types within the different colors: English and American. 
		The breds shed their hair typically two major times a year and have webbed toes. 
		They have short straight hair which is relatively waterproof which helps with swimming. They can also have a black or red nose. 
		The red nose is very rare. As the puppies grow older their coats become noticeably whiter in their old age. 
		Labs also love to eat so obesity can become a problem within the breed. 
        </p>
    <h2>Temperament</h2>
		<p>
		Labrador Retrievers are kind, gentle giants. They are known to be excellent family dogs and have a lot of energy. 
		They grow out of puppy age around age three but do not truly settle down until around age eight of nine. 
		Many labradors are also trained to be service dogs due to their intelligence and patience. This breed also loves human company. 
		All they want in life is to be with their people and help them with their life endeavors. 
		In addition to working in the service field, labs also work and help with hunting, tracking and detection. 
		Labs love to get dirty and swim even in the coldest of water, allowing them to be good search and rescue animals as well. 
		Labs determined personalities allowed them to be suited for many tasks and really provide for their people.
